# react-native-draggable-grid

This is a slightly-customized implementation of `react-native-draggable-grid@2.2.1`. The library code was modified to allow for customizing the heights of grid items on a **per-item basis**, rather than all-or-nothing. Allows headers to be rendered at different size than images.
