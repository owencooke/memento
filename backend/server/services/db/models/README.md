#### WARNING

Files similar to `schema_*_latest.py` are AUTO-GENERATED. Do not edit them directly.

Instead use the command below to sync base models from database:

```bash
poetry run sync-db
```

Other model files can be generated by inheriting/manipulating the base models in separate files, such as `join.py`
